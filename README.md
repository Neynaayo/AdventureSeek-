Hi thank you for downloading my project.
First of all, you need to have Xampp to run this code/any software that can support
(if in xampp put all this file in htdocs or make one file : adventureseek/(all the file).
Next, upload the database in the right place.
for example in Xampp. Open Phpmyadmin and import the project into the database.
and you ready to explore the website!
